1. Each partiticipants must have one system(windows/linux/mac) with preinstalled python to work on 
2. Mode of virtual training is workshop, It is expected that each participant works examples along with instructor 
   Without python installed on the system, participants would be unable to follow all modules
   Download Anaconda2 or Anaconda3 and notepad++ from your internal software server(FAST)
   Note: Python installation takes long time, hence it should be tried offline as minimum time in training would be spent for  troubleshooting installation
3.Open a command promt(cmd) and type 'python'
  If it does not work(gives some error message), mostly environment variable PATH is not updated during installation.
  Find out the installation path of Ananconda/python manually from computer
  and note down that path and use that in command line
  eg if Python is installed in C:\FAST\python3.6 , type 'C:\FAST\python3.6\python' in command prompt 
  Some common locations where Anaconda might be installed  , check for python.exe 
    C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3
    C:\Users\User-Name\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda2
    C:\FAST
    C:\Users\User-Name\Anaconda3
